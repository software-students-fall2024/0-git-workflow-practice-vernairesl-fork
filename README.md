This article gives a introduction to git as a VCS. It explains the concept of repositories, branches and remote, how to create it, how to commit changes, how to use log, how to add files, remove files, and rename files, how to see the status, how to merge, and  all the basic command and concept of git. This article is really useful for git beginners.

I like how this article gives a very simple yet also broad explanation of git and its functions. I was really able to learn more about the git processes in a streamline manner. The graphics also help me understand git better.
